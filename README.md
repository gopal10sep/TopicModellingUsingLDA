# TopicModellingUsingLDA
LDA assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution. Given a dataset of documents, LDA backtracks and tries to figure out what topics would create those documents in the first place. By using the topic modelling technique, we can get an insight so as to what a given document is all about and can tell about the theme of the document.
